Eggshell has a very subtle, low sheen, resembling an eggshell, and is more durable than matte. Satin has a soft, velvety sheen, is highly durable, and easy to clean, making it ideal for high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms. Semi-gloss and gloss have progressively higher sheens and are best for trim, doors, and cabinets.",

      "question": "My paint looks different on the wall than in the can. Why?",
      "answer": "Several factors can influence how paint color appears. Lighting (natural vs. artificial, warm vs. cool), surrounding colors in the room, and the texture of the wall can all affect perception. Always test a sample on your wall and observe it throughout the day under different lighting conditions before committing to the entire room.",

      "question": "I am having trouble applying the paint. What should I do?",
      "answer": "Ensure your surface is properly prepared (clean, dry, smooth). Check the paint can for specific application instructions, including recommended tools (brush, roller, sprayer) and temperature/humidity conditions. If the paint is too thick, it might need thinning (check the label first, as not all paints can be thinned). Watch our application guide videos for step-by-step tutorials.",

      "question": "How do I clean paint brushes and rollers?",
      "answer": "For latex or water-based paints, rinse brushes and rollers thoroughly with warm, soapy water until the water runs clear. Squeeze out excess water and reshape brushes before drying. For oil-based paints, use mineral spirits or a paint thinner for cleaning, then wash with soap and water. Always clean tools immediately after use for best results.",
